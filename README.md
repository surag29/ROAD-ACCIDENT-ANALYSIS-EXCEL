## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of:

- Total number of accidents
- Breakdown by severity (for example, fatal, serious, slight)
- Accidents by:
  - Time period (year, month, day)
  - Road type and conditions
  - Vehicle type
  - Region/area (where available)

Interactive slicers allow filtering the visuals by key dimensions to answer specific questions.
